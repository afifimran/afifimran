# Muhammad Afif Imran's GitHub Repository
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository. My name is Muhammad Afif Imran, and I'm a Computer Science student at UKM (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia). This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and contributions in the field of computer science and programming.

# About Me
As a dedicated computer science student, I am passionate about exploring the vast world of technology and constantly enhancing my skills. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

# Project List
In this repository, you will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my technical capabilities and problem-solving skills. Here are some notable projects:

1. Training Data for DJI RoboMaster using YOLOv5:
Description: This project focuses on training data for object detection using the YOLOv5 model specifically for the DJI RoboMaster competition. The trained model enables accurate detection of various objects used in the competition.
2. License Plate Localization:
Description: This project involves developing a system for license plate localization. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and extract license plate regions from images or video streams.
3. Genetic Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
Description: The goal of this project is to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes the route taken by the salesman to minimize the overall distance traveled.
4. Person and Chair Recognition for DJI Tello Drone:
Description: In this project, I have implemented computer vision algorithms to enable a DJI Tello drone to detect and recognize people and chairs in its surroundings. This can be useful for various applications, such as autonomous navigation or object tracking.
Each project within this repository includes a detailed README file that provides more information about the project's objectives, technologies used, and key features.
